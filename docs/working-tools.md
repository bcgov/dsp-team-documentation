Here we present a list of some tools we use that helps manage work in the Data Science Partnerships Program. 


## Work Tracking & Planning

 - Track and assing work
- GitHub (tracking code-based work)
- Sharepoint/OneDrive (meeting agendas and notes)

## Communications

- Microsoft Teams Channels (for persistent threads)
- Microsoft Teams Chats (for quick transitory records)
- Email

## Collaboration

- Git/GitHub
- Data Innovation Program GitLab

## Records Management

- Storing long-term records on the government LAN
- Shared documents can also be shared on Teams channel sharepoints with the expectation that they will ultimately be transferred over to government LANs.
